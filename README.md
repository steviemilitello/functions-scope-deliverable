## Setup

Fork/clone this repo as directed by your instructor. Inside the repo, create the usual folder structure. Write your answers in `app.js`.




## 1. Verbal questions

Write answers to the following questions as comments. 

1. What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
2. Within a function, what is the difference between **return** and **console.log**?
3. What are the implications of the ability of a function to return a value?

The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 1 - Verbal questions".
<hr>

## 2. Palindrome again.
Write a function `checkPalindrome` that accepts a single argument, a string. See if you can do it without looking back at your previous answer. The function should return true if the string is a palindrome, false if not. Make sure your function will give the correct answer for words with **capital letters**.

```javascript
console.log(checkPalindrome("Radar"));
 => true
```

```javascript
console.log(checkPalindrome("Borscht"));
=> false
```

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 2 - Palindrome".
<hr>

## 3. Digit Sum
Write a function `sumDigits` that accepts a number and returns the sum of its digits.
```js
console.log(sumDigits(42));
=> 6;
```

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 3 - Digit Sum".
<hr>

## 4. Pythagoras
Write a function `calculateSide` that takes two arguments: `sideA` and `sideB`, and returns the solution for sideC using the Pythagorean theorem.

_hint:_ discover the Pythagorean Theorem on a website called google.com

_hint:_ checkout the [Math methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) in javascript

**_restriction_**: for this problem, do NOT use `Math.hypot()` (but for the rest of time, once you've done this problem feel free)
```js
console.log(calculateSide(8, 6));
=> 10
```
<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 4 - Pythagoras".
<hr>

## 5. Sum Array
Write a function `sumArray` that takes an **array** as an argument.
The array should contain numbers. The function should return the sum of the numbers in the array. **Do not use `.reduce()`**.

Expected result:
```javascript
console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]));
=> 21
```
<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 5 - Sum Array".
<hr>

## 6. Prime Numbers
A Prime number is a number that is not evenly divisible by another number except 1 and itself. If you want to read more deeply about it, [go here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number).
To test whether a number is Prime, you only need to test as far as the **square root** of that number. This is advisable for optimization and testing large numbers.

### Step One
Write a function called `checkPrime` that will test whether a number is Prime. The function will return true (Boolean) if Prime, false if not.
_Hint:_ Check every number up to the square root. To do this, try a _for loop_.

### Step Two
Write another function called `printPrimes` that will print (console log) all the Primes up to an arbitrary limit. For example, if you invoke your function with `printPrimes(97)`, it will print all the Prime numbers up to and including 97.
This function can **call on** the previous `checkPrime` function.

# Hungry for more?

1. Write a function `insertDash` that accepts a number as a parameter and returns a string with a dash inserted between any consecutive **odd numbers**. There should not be a dash at the end, it goes only between numbers.
```javascript
console.log(insertDash(454793));

=> 4547-9-3
```

    Commit.

2. Write a function `reverseString` that takes a string as a parameter and returns that string with the letters reversed **without using `.split()`, `.reverse()`, or `.join()`**.

    Commit.

3. Make your palindrome function from problem two above work regardless of spacing (or capitalization). So, for example, "Sit on a potato pan Otis" or "Bird rib" would pass the test.

    Commit.

4. Make your palindrome function work even if the string contains punctuation.  So: "Sit on a potato pan, Otis!!!" or "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama." or "Cigar? Toss it in a can! It is so tragic." would pass the test.

    Commit.

5. Make a "word palindrome" function that returns true if the words in a phrase are the same backwards and forwards.  It should not care about spacing, capitalization, or punctuation.  For example the following string would pass the test: 

    "Son, I am able," she said. "Though you scare me, watch!" said I, "Beloved," I said, "watch me scare you!" Though, said she: "able am I, son."

    Commit.
